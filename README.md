# Thought-on-Process

In this space, I would be putting my thoughts, observations about the software process we follow and add some suggestions about changes we can make.

My suggestions is that, we make our processes so solid that we can pitch even to the investors that we have an awesome product and a team of talented developers and cogent process in place. We are a candidate company to invest in. 

## Getting Started

### Requirements
### Architecture
### Development
### Quality
### Configuration
### Planning and tracking
