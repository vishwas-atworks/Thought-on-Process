# Thought-on-Process

In this space, I would be putting my thoughts, observations about the software process we follow and add some suggestions about changes we can make.

My suggestions is that, we make our processes so solid that we can pitch even to the investors that we have an awesome product and a team of talented developers and cogent process in place. We are a candidate company to invest in. 

## Getting Started

Before we get started, I am scrutinizing our process into 9 practice areas i.e:

### Requirements
### Architecture

Our Architecture is scalable, extensible and can handle need of growning markets. Let us have/review our architecture diagrams to match the Architectural diagrams and have various views of our software.

### Development
### Quality
### Configuration
### Planning and tracking
### Risk Management
### Production Support
### Customer Onboarding
### Research
