In this space, I would be putting my thoughts, observations about the software process we follow and add some suggestions about changes we can make.

My suggestions is that, we make our processes so solid that we can pitch even to the investors that we have an awesome product and a team of talented developers and cogent process in place. We are a candidate company to invest in. 

## Getting Started

### Requirements
### Architecture
### Development
### Quality
### Configuration
### Planning and tracking
### Risk Management
### Production Support
### Customer Onboarding
### Research

Before we get started, I am scrutinizing our process into 9 practice areas i.e:

Requirements should not talk about implementation details. It should just focus on conveying requeirements in plain english rather than diving into the impelmentation details.

It should goal model, use cases - so that a developer/designer understands the business scenario and is able to comprehend the how does this requirement fits into existing architecture.

### Architecture

Let us follow standard notations for drawing architecture diagram
