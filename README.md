# My thoughts on process

In this space, I would be putting my thoughts, observations about the software process we follow and add some suggestions about changes we can make.

My suggestions is that, we make our processes so solid that we can pitch even to the investors that we have an awesome product and a team of talented developers and cogent process in place. We are a candidate company to invest in.

The goal of this document is to provide actionable items so that we become better with the process. Idea is, that we should already have an action documented for a scenario that arises, thus minimizing leadership

## Getting Started

### Requirements
### Architecture
### Development
### Quality
### Configuration
### Planning and tracking
### Risk Management
### Production Support
### Customer Onboarding
### Research

Before we get started, I am scrutinizing our process into 9 practice areas i.e:

### Requirements

Requirements/Product Manager (Victor/Savio)
Lead the process of requirements elicitation and consolidation.
Responsible for requirements change management 

Requirements should not talk about implementation details. It should just focus on conveying requeirements in plain english rather than diving into the impelmentation details. Even if these requirements are coming from someone who can write code.
Implementation details need to go in Architecture and design documents. The idea is to ensure requirements traceability.

It should goal model, use cases - so that a developer/designer understands the business scenario and is able to comprehend the how does this requirement fits into existing architecture.

### Architecture

Our Architecture is scalable, extensible and can handle need of growning markets. Let us have/review our architecture diagrams to match the Architectural diagrams and have various views of our software.

Let us follow standard notations for drawing architecture diagram
Identify Quality attributes --> What quality attributes can you support right now?

### Development

Process for UX integration

No commented code to be checked in. 
Keep the code clean.

Java Doc,
by dfault code should be standard to OneLynk.

### Quality

Verification strategy:
Functionality
Quality Atrributes

Performance test

Have set of test cases marked for various release. Even if it is smoke test we should know what works and what doesn't in our

Have templates for creating bug tickets:
#### QA
Write in ticket:
What failed?
Modules affected, affect on customer
Test cases that you expect to pass

#### Developer
Write in ticket:
What you have fixed?
How you have fixed?
Test cases you executed to make sure the fix is correct and complete

### Configuration Management


### Planning and tracking

Burn down charts
Code freeze

### Risk Management

There are various axes on which a scheduled delivery might be at risk.

#### Technical issues
#### Non Technical issues

### Production Support
### Customer Onboarding

I am customer, just walk in to the 
### Research
Create a culture of innovation. No one needs a cheaper version of SAP - may be they do, but keywords do sell in the VC market.
Blockchain based database.
Integrate with IoT (from Jin's slide)
Every one wants TV, but smart TV with Airplay is much better than traditional one.
